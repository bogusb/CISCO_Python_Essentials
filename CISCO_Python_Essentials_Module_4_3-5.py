# 4.3. RETURNING RESULTS FROM FUNCTIONS

### 4.3.1.1 Returning a result from a function
# # Effects and results: the return instruction

# All the previously presented functions have some kind of effect -
# they produce some text and send it to the console.
#
# Of course, functions - like their mathematical siblings - may have results.
#
# To get functions to return a value (but not only for this purpose)
# you use the return instruction.
#
# This word gives you a full picture of its capabilities.
# Note: it's a Python keyword.
#
#
# The return instruction has two different variants -
# let's consider them separately.
#

# # # return without an expression
# The first consists of the keyword itself, without anything following it.
#
# When used inside a function, it causes the immediate termination of the function's execution, and an instant return (hence the name) to the point of invocation.
#
# Note: if a function is not intended to produce a result, using the return instruction is not obligatory - it will be executed implicitly at the end of the function.
#
# Anyway, you can use it to terminate a function's activities on demand, before the control reaches the function's last line.
#
# Let's consider the following function:
#
# def happy_new_year(wishes = True):
#     print("Three...")
#     print("Two...")
#     print("One...")
#     if not wishes:
#         return
#
#     print("Happy New Year!")
#
#
# When invoked without any arguments:
#
# happy_new_year()
#
#
# The function causes a little noise - the output will look like this:
#
# Three...
# Two...
# One...
# Happy New Year!
# output
#
#
# Providing False as an argument:
#
# happy_new_year(False)
#
#
# will modify the function's behavior - the return instruction will cause its termination just before the wishes - this is the updated output:
#
# Three...
# Two...
# One...
# output
#
#
#
# return with an expression
# The second return variant is extended with an expression:
#
# def function():
#     return expression
#
#
# There are two consequences of using it:
#
# it causes the immediate termination of the function's execution (nothing new compared to the first variant)
# moreover, the function will evaluate the expression's value and will return (hence the name once again) it as the function's result.
# Yes, we already know - this example isn't really sophisticated:
#
# def boring_function():
#     return 123
#
# x = boring_function()
#
# print("The boring_function has returned its result. It's:", x)
#
#
# The snippet writes the following text to the console:
#
# The boring_function has returned its result. It's: 123
#
# Let's investigate it for a while.
#
# Analyze the figure below: Assigning the value returned by function to a variable
#
# The return instruction, enriched with the expression (the expression is very simple here), "transports" the expression's value to the place where the function has been invoked.
#
# The result may be freely used here, e.g., to be assigned to a variable.
#
# It may also be completely ignored and lost without a trace.
#
#
# Note, we're not being too polite here - the function returns a value, and we ignore it (we don't use it in any way):
#
# def boring_function():
#     print("'Boredom Mode' ON.")
#     return 123
#
# print("This lesson is interesting!")
# boring_function()
# print("This lesson is boring...")
#
#
# The program produces the following output:
#
# This lesson is interesting!
# 'Boredom Mode' ON.
# This lesson is boring...
# output
#
#
# Is it punishable? Not at all.
#
# The only disadvantage is that the result has been irretrievably lost.
#
# Don't forget:
#
# you are always allowed to ignore the function's result, and be satisfied with the function's effect (if the function has any)
# if a function is intended to return a useful result, it must contain the second variant of the return instruction.
# Wait a minute - does this mean that there are useless results, too? Yes - in some sense.
